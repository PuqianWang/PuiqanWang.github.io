Hi, my name is Puqian Wang, a CS PhD student at University of Wisconsin - Madison, since September 2021. My research interests primarily revolve around the intersection of optimization and computational learning theory. I am very fortunate to be advised by prof. Jelena Diakonikolas. Additionally, I have the privilege of collaborating with Prof. Ilias Diakonikolas and other amazing collaboraters. Prior to joining Madison, I completed my B.S. degree in Mathematics at Shandong University, where I had the opportunity to be advised by Prof. Guanghui Wang. I also worked with prof. Congying Han at UCAS during my undergraduate study.
